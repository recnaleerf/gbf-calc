# GBF Attack Calculator

A work-in-progress experimental attack calculator for [Granblue Fantasy](http://granbluefantasy.jp).

## Dependencies

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com)

## Building

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run build      # Run clean and build scripts
```

You can also manually run the clean and build scripts if you choose. They can be found in `bin/`.

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

Then nagivate yourself to `localhost:5000`.

Running the app like this will run the clean and build scripts before starting the server.

## Deploying

The project is ready for deployment to Heroku. Heroku will automatically install dependencies, clean/build and then start the server. Hopefully.
